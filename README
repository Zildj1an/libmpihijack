libmpihijack: Function interposition library for MPI primitives

About

================================================================================================

This library uses function interposition to hijack all the MPI primites.

The code only prints a message and looks for the next symbol (possibly the MPI library function).

The code it is intended to use as a skeleton to start a project that needs traps the MPI primitives.
